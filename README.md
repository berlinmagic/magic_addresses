# MagicAddresses

An address gem for rails .. fetches *country*, *state*, *city*, *district* and *subdistrict* in seperated and translated models.

This gives the great advantage, that each address can be displayed in each language. And not matter how you write an address it fetches the right one.
For example the german city *munich* in german *MÃ¼nchen* .. both save a city-model with a name translated all app-locales. 

```ruby
rails g magic_addresses:install
```

- 1. **check the initialers** (*its important to first check the settings of the gem*)
- 2. **check the migration file**
- 3. **run `rake db:migrate`**
- 4. **add to your models**


## Features

- full tranlated addresses
- allways correct addresses (query to google/verbatim service)
- addresses, cities, countries, and so one, are uniq (i.e. only one "New-York" with lots of addresses, districts, ..)
- perfect order ( city has X addresses )
- postgresql earthdistance included (for distance checks)
- tested




## New
since version `0.0.13` addresses are uniq, so the same address never will be saved twice, instead owners share one address

run:
```ruby
rails g magic_addresses:update
```
to update old addresses and add the new structure


##### You can add Earthdistance plugin later!
run:
```ruby
rails g magic_addresses:add_earthdistance
```
be sure to activate it in initializer before migrate!



### Model methods

```ruby
  has_one_address     # => This model has one address associated with it. (ie: User)

  has_addresses       # => This model has many addresses. (ie: Company)

#   You can use `has_one_address` and `has_addresses` on the same model 
#   `has_one_address` sets the default flag so could be major address.

  has_nested_address  # => Has one directly nested addresses. (ie: User.street, User.city)

```

### View Mehtods

```ruby
  
  <%= country_flag( :de, "small" ) %>
  # flag helper for all default countries ( "small" | "medium" | "large")
  
  <%= render "magic_addresses/addresses/fields/address", f: f %>
  # form helper for 'has_one_address'
  
```

### in your Controllers:

```ruby
  
  private
  
    # Never trust parameters from the scary internet! ... has_one_address
    def instance_params
      params.require(:instance).permit( .. :address_attributes => [:id, :street, :number, :postalcode, :city, :country, :_destroy] .. )
    end
    
    
    # Never trust parameters from the scary internet! ... has_addresses
    def instance_params
      params.require(:instance).permit( .. :addresses_attributes => [:id, :street, :number, :postalcode, :city, :country, :_destroy] .. )
    end
  
  - or -
  
  :address_attributes => MagicAddresses::Address::PARAMS      # has_one_address
  :addresses_attributes => MagicAddresses::Address::PARAMS    # has_addresses
  
```


## Configuration
```ruby
  
  MagicAddresses.configure do |config|
    # in which locales addresses should be saved
    config.active_locales = [:en, :de]
    # what is the default language (should be :en, except you don't need english at all)
    config.default_locale = :en
    # what is the default country for query
    config.default_country = "Germany"
    # add default country in each query ?
    config.query_defaults = true
    # only save tranlations when differs from default-locale?
    config.uniq_translations = true
    # use a background-process for the lookups ( :none | :sidekiq )
    config.job_backend = :none
    # use a postgres earthdistance for distance calculation
    config.earthdistance = false
  end
  
```

since version 0.0.24 you can only run rspec from the project folder:
```ruby
~/Sites/magic_addresses:$ rspec spec

the symlink in the dummy folder is removed for compatibility with ruby 2.2
